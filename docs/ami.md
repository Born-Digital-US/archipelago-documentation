# Archipelago Multi-Importer

[Archipelago Multi-Importer (AMI)](https://github.com/esmero/ami) is a module for batch/bulk/mass ingests of Archipelago digital objects and collections. AMI also enables you to perform batch administrative actions, such as updating, patching/revising, or deleting digital objects and collections.

### *Work-in-Progress Notes*

*Please be aware that the version of AMI shipped with Archipelago 1.0.0-RC1 provides much of the core batch import and update functions for getting started working with large amounts of content, but is not the full or final version of this module. This documentation page will be updated with successive AMI and Archipelago releases.*

## Getting started with AMI

You can access AMI through the `AMI Sets` tab on the main Content page found at `/admin/content`
